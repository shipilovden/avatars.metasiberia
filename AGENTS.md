# Metasibir Avatar Creator - AGENTS.md

## Purpose
- This project is a standalone local avatar creator built on top of downloaded Ready Player Me assets.
- The UI does not try to clone the original RPM editor. We keep our own flow and our own scene composition logic.

## Current Dataset
- Source app: `demo`
- Source app id: `6421563c21169e32c89017a0`
- Supported types: `top`, `bottom`, `footwear`, `outfit`, `hair`, `eye`, `eyeshape`, `eyebrows`, `faceshape`, `noseshape`, `lipshape`, `glasses`, `headwear`, `beard`, `facewear`
- Source filters now include:
  - `bodyType = generic + fullbody`
  - `gender = male + female + neutral`
- Raw source catalog lives in [src/data/assets-catalog.json](./src/data/assets-catalog.json)
- Current catalog snapshot totals:
  - total unique assets: `622`
  - male library: `516`
  - female library: `521`

## Local Asset Pipeline
- `yarn assets:sync-catalog`
  - Runs `scripts/sync-asset-catalog.mjs`
  - Pulls the source asset catalog from Ready Player Me and writes `src/data/assets-catalog.json`
- `yarn assets:download`
  - Runs `scripts/download-local-library.mjs`
  - Downloads gender-specific base presets and local asset GLBs/icons
  - Writes `src/data/generated/local-library-manifest.json`
- `yarn assets:build`
  - Runs `scripts/build-assets-manifest.mjs`
  - Rebuilds generated type/group manifests and `src/data/generated/local-asset-capabilities.json`

## Storage Layout
- Gender-specific base presets:
  - `public/local-assets/base/male/preset-*.glb`
  - `public/local-assets/base/female/preset-*.glb`
- Preset previews:
  - `public/local-assets/presets/male/preset-*.png`
  - `public/local-assets/presets/female/preset-*.png`
- Gender-specific asset GLBs:
  - `public/local-assets/glb/male/<type>/<id>.glb`
  - `public/local-assets/glb/female/<type>/<id>.glb`
- Shared icons:
  - `public/local-assets/icons/<type>/<id>.<ext>`

## Runtime Rules
- The app keeps its own local composition flow in [src/App.tsx](./src/App.tsx).
- Gender selection switches the active local library and the available base presets.
- The "body" choice in this project is implemented as a curated base preset switch, not as a direct RPM `bodyShape` asset pipeline.
- Face-shape controls are implemented with additional local asset types:
  - `faceshape` (head shape)
  - `eyeshape` (eye shape)
  - `eyebrows` (eyebrow shape)
  - `noseshape` (nose shape)
  - `lipshape` (lip shape)
- On gender switch, incompatible selected assets are cleared.
- On preset switch, `beard` and `facewear` are reset to avoid head-slot conflicts between different base meshes.

## Export Rules
- Keep the Ready Player Me export pipeline as the base export path. Do not replace it with a full local `GLTFExporter` scene export: that previously broke skeleton / skinning compatibility in Metasiberia.
- Local preview and exported RPM preset `Wolf3D_Outfit_Top` were verified to use the same node and the same `TEXCOORD_0` UV data for `male/preset-1`. The main mismatch was not missing UVs.
- The export post-process in [src/App.tsx](./src/App.tsx) depends on image baking for replacement textures and decals. If you touch this logic, preserve the current `flipY = false` behavior used for the temporary transform texture in `drawReplacementPattern()`. Leaving Three.js default `flipY = true` causes mirrored / shifted placement compared to the editor.
- When modifying exported textures, do not overwrite a shared material/image globally. Work on cloned target materials/textures only, otherwise the texture leaks onto collar / trim / unrelated clothing parts.
- If export stops matching the editor again, first compare:
  1. local base preset GLB in `public/local-assets/base/...`
  2. exported RPM GLB for the same preset/template
  3. `Wolf3D_Outfit_Top` node, primitive material, and `TEXCOORD_0`
  Do this before changing transform math.

## Verification Status
- Checked on `2026-03-25`.
- `src/data/generated/local-library-manifest.json` resolves to real files for both libraries:
  - male: `516` assets, `0` missing GLB, `0` missing icon, `4` presets, `0` missing base, `0` missing preview
  - female: `521` assets, `0` missing GLB, `0` missing icon, `4` presets, `0` missing base, `0` missing preview
- Production build passes with `yarn build`.
- Current remaining warning is Vite's large bundle warning only.

## REG.RU Deployment
- Production hostname: `avatars.metasiberia.com`
- Canonical URL: `https://avatars.metasiberia.com`
- Mirror hostname: `https://www.avatars.metasiberia.com`
- Legacy hostname: `https://mac.metasiberia.com` and `https://www.mac.metasiberia.com` should redirect to the canonical URL once the new trusted certificate is active
- Hosting provider: REG.RU shared hosting via ISPmanager
- Remote web root: `/var/www/u2978374/data/www/avatars.metasiberia.com`
- DNS target: `37.140.192.242`
- Target public certificate: `avatars.metasiberia.com_le3` (Let's Encrypt request created on `2026-03-26`, trusted issuance still needs verification before forcing legacy redirects)
- Keep the canonical redirect + SPA fallback rules in [public/.htaccess](./public/.htaccess) when changing hosting behavior
- Routine deploys should use the incremental script instead of rebuilding/uploading a multi-gigabyte archive:
  - `yarn deploy:reg-ru`
  - `yarn deploy:reg-ru -- --skip-build`
  - `yarn deploy:reg-ru:prune`
- Machine-readable local deploy config lives in `.secrets/reg-ru-deploy.secret.json` and is intentionally gitignored
- Human-readable local access notes live in `.secrets/reg-ru-access.local.md` and are intentionally gitignored
- Tracked deployment instructions live in [docs/REG_RU_DEPLOY.md](./docs/REG_RU_DEPLOY.md)

## Important Constraint
- Do not revert back to the old single-base setup.
- If the asset catalog is refreshed, regenerate all three stages in order:
  1. `yarn assets:sync-catalog`
  2. `yarn assets:download`
  3. `yarn assets:build`
